This is a browser extension that lets you skip over the commentary sections on [Ceddo's](https://www.youtube.com/@dailyceddo) First Dates reaction videos. It works by detecting the portrait in the bottom right corner. This protrait is only visible if the First Dates video is playing. If it is not visible, we skip until it is visible again.
